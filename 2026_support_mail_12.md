 Welcome to the January edition of SupportMail.
 For those of you new to this aggregation, SupportMail is an internal
 email assembled by the Support team to highlight noteworthy tickets,
 calls, events, etc., that seem likely to be of interest to a larger
 audience. Inclusions are for information purposes and are not limited
 to unsolved issues.
 

 If you think any internal party should be added to this distribution
 list, please send a request and email address to

 Here are some of the trends we've noticed in the past month:
 















1
Support demand tracks product depth, not customer confusion
-----------------------------------------------------------




 The biggest drivers across charts are **platform limitations**, **product investigations**, and **platform incidents/performance**.
 




![Tickets by Topic Domain Treemap](https://dozens.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/learnosity/Tickets%20by%20Topic%20Domain.png)



Evidence across viz
* Topic\-domain treemap dominated by platform/product categories
* Strategic \+ Stable cells remain high in lifecycle heatmap
* Emerging tier produces high raw volume but not the only high\-impact segment






**Notable conclusion:**

 Support load rises as customers succeed and scale. This is a product surface\-area \+ maturity signal, not a “read the docs” problem.
 





2

“Stable” and “Strategic” are high\-demand and high\-stakes
----------------------------------------------------------



 Stable does *not* mean low effort. Strategic accounts generate fewer tickets than Emerging, but the issues tend to be more consequential.

Risk pattern

 A single incident or performance hit can outweigh months of normal operations for strategic customers.
 


Operational reality

 High\-value customers are “stable” because Support is effective, not because they require less support.
 



**Notable conclusion:**

 Retention exposure is driven by **severity \+ uncertainty**, not raw ticket counts.
 







3

Product Investigation is the strongest early\-warning signal
------------------------------------------------------------



 It appears prominently in the topic treemap and repeats in renewal\-risk accounts. That combination is a giant blinking sign.

Why it matters

 Customers tolerate bugs better than “we don’t know why this happens.” Ambiguity erodes confidence fast.
 


Practical interpretation

 Treat Product Investigation tickets as **churn predictors \+ roadmap inputs**, not routine support work.
 



**Notable conclusion:**

 A “Product Investigation” label is a signal that product intent, observability, or constraints are unclear to the customer.
 







4

Markets have different problem “signatures”
-------------------------------------------



 The Market × Topic composition shows issue mixes vary heavily by market. Same platform, different pain.

K\-12 pattern

 Fragmented mix: environment variability, browsers/devices, delivery constraints, configuration churn.
 


Corporate/Workforce pattern

 Reliability and scale: performance, compatibility, operational expectations, integration friction.
 


Higher Ed pattern

 Assessment correctness: integrity, behavior precision, edge\-case logic, grading/handling nuance.
 


Adult/Vocational pattern

 Hybrid mix: classroom\-style assessment needs plus production\-style operational requirements.
 



**Notable conclusion:**

 Market\-aware product strategy and support specialization will outperform generalist approaches.
 







5

Ticket volume is a misleading success metric
--------------------------------------------



 Emerging drives volume; Strategic drives impact; Independent is quiet (which could mean healthy… or disengaged).

Better measurement lens

 Track: severity mix, Product Investigation rates, incident exposure, renewal watchlist triggers, time\-to\-confidence.
 


Why this matters

 Low volume can hide churn risk; high volume can reflect high adoption. Context beats counts.
 



**Notable conclusion:**

 Measure Support by risk reduction and confidence restoration, not by deflection or raw ticket suppression.
